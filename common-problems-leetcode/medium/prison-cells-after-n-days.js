/*
There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.  

Each  day,  whether  the  cell  is  occupied  or vacant changes according to the
following rules:                                                                

If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then
the cell becomes occupied.                                                      

Otherwise, it becomes vacant.                                                   

(Note  that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row
can't have two adjacent neighbors.)                                             

We  describe the current state of the prison in the following way: cells[i] == 1
if the i-th cell is occupied, else cells[i] == 0.                               

Given  the  initial  state of the prison, return the state of the prison after N
days (and N such changes described above.)                                      

                                                                                

Example 1:                                                                      

Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], N = 7                                         

Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]                                                       

Explanation:                                                                    

The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:             

Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]                                                 

Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]                                                 

Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]                                                 

Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]                                                 

Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]                                                 

Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]                                                 

Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]                                                 

Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]

/*
Notes:

For the most part you can just brute force this. There's one trick to 
avoid timeout for high N though. We can note that if we encounter a state a 
second time, then we know that we're cycling. Therefore we can quit early.
