Notes:

Brute force would be to calculate the manhattan distances between all
biker-worker combinations. Then we put those into a priority queue.
Then we keep popping off distances until there are none left. If 
we pop off a distance for a worker or bike that has already been accounted
for, we just continue to the next distance. 
^This is O(N^2)

What else could we do?


O(M*N) space and time solution...
This is a great time to use bucket sort:
