"""
Given a positive integer N, how many ways can we write it as a sum of consecutive positive integers?

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 = 5 = 2 + 3
Example 2:

Input: 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 9 = 9 = 4 + 5 = 2 + 3 + 4
Example 3:

Input: 15
Output: 4
Explanation: 15 = 15 = 8 + 7 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
Note: 1 <= N <= 10 ^ 9.

Notes:

I could see this being a good problem for a Math exam, but this seems like a silly question for
a programming interview. It's all a math derivation and then plain, procedural code.
