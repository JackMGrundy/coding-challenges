"""
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an nÃ—n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.



Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

Example:

Input: 4
Output: [
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.

"""
The key idea to this problem and the initial solution came quickly. The real learning came from this attempt. 
This
problem is a fantastic illustration of backtracking. 

1) Backtracking is more general than DFS, but often involves DFS as it does here
2) The art is in coming up with a concise representation  of the problem (board in this case), efficiently 
trying a line of thought and efficiently reversing it before trying another path.

The goal is to think of what the absolute simplest representation we can reduce the problem too. Like
finding the minimum state in ract.

In this case...as we march through the columns (or rows equivalently), we don't actually need the whole
board. We can do just fine with 3 columns worth...one for the columns and two for the diagonals.
The key step: say we dropped a king in row 1 of column 1. No say we taking car of row 2. Then the
unavailable diagonal spit is going to be (cur col - prev col) + prev place = (2 - 1) + 1 = 2. Therefore,
we know the diagonal impact of previous placements given the current column number. 

Random notes on bitwise operators:
Recall: & -> bitwise and...so x & 1 is always going to be 1 or 0...so, this is just an obtuse
(but fast) even or odd operator. 
And...>> is bit shifting...so x >> 1 is the same as // 2.

While these can produce speedup, I think the decrease in readbility/maintainabiliy frequently isn't
worth it...a key benefit of python is supposed to be clarity. We might as well use Java or C++ if
speed is so critical. 

Important note on python array referencing:
Note that it's path + [createRow(j)] works in the dfs call, because python makes a new list
when concatenation is used. This is why we don't have to delete anything from the list after the
dfs call.
