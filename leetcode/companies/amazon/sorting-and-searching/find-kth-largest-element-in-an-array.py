"""
Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5
Example 2:

Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4
Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.
